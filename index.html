<h3>Gauss's Law for Flux</h3>

  Gauss's Law for Flux is a simple way to express the relation between vector fields in physics and their sources – e.g. between the gravitational field and masses, between the electric field and electric charges, and between the magnetic field and magnetic dipoles. Gauss's Law is useful in determining the total electric or gravitational field originating from distributions of charges or masses, which have enough symmetry. It is often easier in these situations to use Gauss's Law than to add up all contributions to the total field coming from each individual part of the charge or mass distribution.
<br>
Gauss's Law involves a quantity called the flux (also known as the integrated flux or the total flux) of the electric, gravitational, or magnetic field out of an imaginary two-dimensional surface. This surface is then the boundary of a three-dimensional volume. The two-dimensional surface should be regarded as a purely mathematical construct, which should not be confused with any material surface which may be part of the physical situation. As an example, you can imagine a three-dimensional portion of space in the shape of a ball, and the corresponding surface would be its boundary which is a sphere.
<br>
In the case of substances, or energy, which physically flow through space and in particular through a given surface, flux refers to the rate of flow (of substance or energy) across the surface. But one can define the flux of any vector field through a surface even if, as in the case of the electric, gravitational, or magnetic field, the vector field does not describe the flow of any physical entity.
<br>
Gauss's Law states that given such a two-dimensional surface, if one sums up the normal components of the field over the entire surface, the result is
<br>❐ proportional to the net total charge enclosed by the surface (i.e. the net charge present in the portion of space whose boundary is the surface), in the case of the electric field;
<br>❐ proportional to the total mass enclosed by the surface (i.e. the total mass present in the portion of space whose boundary is the surface), in the case of the gravitational field;
<br>❐ equal to zero, in the case of the magnetic field.
